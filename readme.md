Cross-city traffic flow prediction is a vital intelligent transportation research direction, targeting traffic data scarcity in target cities. Existing methods learn shared spatio-temporal patterns to alleviate negative transfer from city-specific differences, yet neglect that traffic propagation causality between upstream and downstream regions is inherently consistent despite varying road network structures. Current causal research mostly focuses on indirect causality from temporal periodicity or is limited to single spatial granularity causal analysis. Insufficient integration of multi-granularity semantic representations and multi-scale causal dependencies restricts prediction accuracy. Moreover, modeling efficiency for long-sequence traffic dependencies is inadequate, and existing cross-city transfer methods partially ignore semantic structure alignment, hindering knowledge transfer effectiveness. To address this, we propose SC2-Mamba, a Semantic-Causal Clustering Mamba framework for cross-city traffic flow prediction. First, spatial-semantics-guided soft clustering yields coarse-grained semantic representations, capturing multi-scale spatial dependencies and upstream-downstream causal influences at both coarse and fine granularities. Second, a causal-guided Mamba prediction module is applied at both granularities to efficiently model traffic flow variations. Third, a semantic-causal feature alignment mechanism combined with target-domain fine-tuning enhances cross-city generalization. Extensive experiments on real-world traffic datasets show that SC2-Mamba significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods and achieves superior generalization in cross-city transfer scenarios.
